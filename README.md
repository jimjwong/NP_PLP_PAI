## What To Expect From This Course

- This short course aims to provide a foundational introduction to Python programming for the purposes of AI work.
- While this course may cover quite a wide range of topics and hence feel intense, there are a lot of intermediate and advanced concepts which would not be part of the scope, due to the short length of time given to the course.
- If you hope to be even more proficient and acquainted with programming, you are advised to pursue intermediate/advanced courses in programming on your own after this course. The foundations learnt here will help you pick the advanced concepts quicker.
